## Running the tests

This application will take in arguments, of which the first argument after the file needs to be one of the following commands:

The following arguments would be an artist or band for concert-this, song title for spotify-this-song, movie title for movie-this, and nothing for do-what-it-says.

These arguments will display venue, venue location, and date if concert-this is specified in the command argument.  The screen will display artist, song title, link to a preview of the song, and album if spotify-this-song is specified. For movie-this, the screen will display movie title, release year, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, language of movie, plot of the movie, and actors in the movie.  The do-what-it-says command will pull text from a file, random.txt, and execute what is stored on the file.  In addition, the screen outputs will be logged to a log.txt file and stored in the Liribot directory.
